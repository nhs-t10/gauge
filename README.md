# gauge
T-10 (4096)'s entry for the imaginethis.io IoT competition

**gauge** opens your tabletop into a world of Internet-connected data possibilities. Simply select the data you'd like to show, and print the unique gauge face to affix to your device.

The data your gauge can display ranges from the weather, to presidential delegate count, to days until your FTC Robotics team's regional competition. With minimal setup, a small servo and Particle Photon can be turned into a magical blend of analog and digital, representing the vast metrics that the internet today has to offer.

And it's fully automated and easily customizable, thanks to our web interface and servo daemon.

##FIRST Robotics

As the need for an online presence of FIRST teams has only been increasing, it's important to keep track of the metrics which can define a team's success in outreach.

From the number of a team's twitter followers, to the success of a hashtag, to the progress of a GoFundMe fundraiser, displaying this information in a personal, passive setting can prove extremely useful.

Support for metrics such as these are built-in to the gauge project. You can simply select, configure and print any metric to your desire within seconds.
