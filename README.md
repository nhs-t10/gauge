T-10 (4096)'s entry for the imaginethis.io IoT competition

**gauge** opens your tabletop into a world of Internet-connected data possibilities. Simply select the data you'd like to show, and print the unique gauge face to affix to your device.

The data your gauge can display ranges from the weather, to presidential delegate count, to days until your FTC Robotics team's regional competition. With minimal setup, a small servo and Particle Photon can be turned into a magical blend of analog and digital, representing the vast metrics that the internet today has to offer.

And it's fully automated and easily customizable, thanks to our web interface and servo daemon.
